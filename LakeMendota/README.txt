Meteorological forcing data were obtained from the second phase of the North American Land Data Assimilation
System (NLDAS-2, Xia, Y., Mitchell, K., Ek, M., Sheffield, J., Cosgrove, B., Wood, E., Luo, L., Alonge, C., Wei, H., Meng, J., Livneh, B.,

The model data to run the Lake Mendota simulation, including configuration files and driver data are available at the
Environmental Data Initiative (https://portal540s.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-ntl&identifier=389&revision=1)
and are part of the following publication:
Ladwig, R., Hanson, P. C., Dugan, H. A., Carey, C. C., Zhang, Y., Shu, L., Duffy, C. J., and Cobourn, K. M.: Lake thermal structure drives
inter-annual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37 years, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss.,
