This example demonstrates how to set up LakeEnsemblR for a reservoir, with outflows at multiple depths. The original data comes from Lough Feeagh,
although the outflows at depth do not exist in reality.

Lough Feeagh data was collected by the Marine Institute. A permanently moored thermistor chain at the deepest point in Lough Feeagh measures water temperature at 13 depths (0.9, 2.5, 5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 27, 32, 42). This dataset comprises data collected between 2004 and 2019 which has gone through detailed QA/QC. See [here](http://data.marine.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/ie.marine.data:dataset.2817) (de Eyto et al., 2020).
Bathymetry of Lough Feeagh is also available from [here](http://data.marine.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/ie.marine.data:dataset.1226).
